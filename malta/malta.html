<h1>Malta, an all year destination</h1>
<h2>History, Culture and beautiful beaches</h2>
<p>Malta is a place worth visiting all year round, with good weather even in the cold months - compared to other European cities which are freezing in the winter, here you can still find temperatures above zero even in the colder months. But since we were - again - limited by school vacations, we decided to visit in the summer, so for us the focus was on the beaches. And believe me, there are enough beaches to keep you busy for the whole summer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we didn’t”t have the whole summer, but about ten days to explore the island. We decided to take it slow and concentrate on the north shore - best for beaches and we heard also best for families. The temperatures during the day were sometimes close to 40 degrees so, since travelling with a child, we based our activities on being close to the water. The good news is that here you have plenty of ways to escape the heat as you will see below.</p>

<small>Our first view upon arriving in Malta</small>
<p>We arrived early and took an Uber to our Airbnb in the north of Malta, the ride took about 30 minutes and cost about 30 euros which was totally worth it. We were very tired having travelled in the middle of the night but excited to explore. So after a quick nap we headed to Għajn Tuffieħa. We took an Uber again - too hot for the bus - and as soon as we got off I was impressed by the view. The beach is at the bottom of a steep cliff and there is a nice photo spot with swings on the top. Going down the stairs you easily get to the golden sand and the blue sea… We spent many hours here, there were some waves but our son likes it and I found he beach child friendly (but not indicated for very small kids maybe, also not very accessible if you come with a stroller). There are also not many spots on the shade so either bring or rent an umbrella.
</p>
<p>We bought our own umbrella and used it during the whole trip - I think it was a better deal than renting, specially because there seemed to be some stress going on among the people who rented them, I actually saw them fighting once and screaming a at each other a few times at other beaches… There are places to buy your own umbrella as well as other “last-minute-beach-appliances” right next to the paring lot / bus stop. There was also a stand selling Colombian food (the empanadas were great) and the bar Singita is right next to the beach and famous as a sunset hot spot. </p>
